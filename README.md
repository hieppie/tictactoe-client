# Tic-Tac Toes: A duel between Tic-Tac and Toes

This application allows the user to sign up, sign in, and sign out on a server. A signed in user/player can play a the game of Tic-Tac-Toes. To stop playing the user can sign out. I want to make a simple Tic-Tac-Toe game with just a little twist to the title and the theme and making it Tic-Tac vs Toes.

## Planning

### User Stories
- As a new user I want to be able to sign up for an account and be notified if the sign up is a success or failure
- As a returning user I want to be able to sign in and be notified if the sign in is a success or failure
- As a signed in user I want to be able to see the game board and to click Start Game to play. Tic-Tac always go first followed by Toes. 
- As a user I want to be able to click on the box on the game board and occupy the box with the either Tic-Tac or Toes
- As a user I want to be unable to change the character on the box once it is occupied
- As a user I want to be notified if I won after one of the winning condition is met and which character won.
- As a user I want to be able to restart a game with a new cleared game board
- As a user I want to be able to sign out and be notified if the sign out is a success.
